ReactOS - Minecraft Computercraft Bigreactors Automation

Description
=======
The script assumes that a monitor is attached to the left ( a big 4x2 advanced monitor is recommended ) 
It displays reactor information while the script is not being interacted via terminal. 
All the configurations and options may be altered via terminal and are pretty self explanatory
For now, only one reactor is supported through 2 wired modems
